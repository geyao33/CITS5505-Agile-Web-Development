                        <p>In the nature and society, there are many events will happen certianly. For example, when we
                            throw a stone upward, it must move dowanward at the end. Two like electric charges will
                            repel
                            each other. However, there are some other different events will happen uncertianly, such as,
                            when we toss a coin, we cannot tell it will land on heads or tails. or When we toss a dice,
                            we cannot tell which number it will land on. Therefore, we need probability to describe how
                            likely something is to happen.
                        </p>

                            <br> When rolling one dice, there are six outcomes.

                        <p>Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis,
                            interpretation,
                            and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social
                            problem,
                            it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be
                            studied.
                            Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in
                            terms of
                            the design of surveys and experiments.
                            <br>In the statistics, the most important is data. Data are facts and figures that are
                            collected,
                            analyzed, and summarized for presentation and interpretation. Sample survey methods are used
                            to
                            collect data from observational studies, and experimental design methods are used to collect
                            data
                            from experimental studies. The area of descriptive statistics is concerned primarily with
                            methods
                            of presenting and interpreting data using graphs, tables, and numerical summaries.

                        <p> <b>Discrete Variables</b> are numeric variables that have a countable number of values
                            between any two values. A discrete variable is always numeric.

                            an infinite number of values between any two values. A continuous variable can be numeric
                            or date/time.
                        </p>
                        <p> <b>Example</b>
                            <br>The number of coins, the number of customer, and the number of cups are countable, so
                            they

                        <h3>Expected Value</h3>
                        <p>The expected value in statistics is same with the expected value in probability. The expected
                            value
                            of a random variable <b>X</b>, denoted <b>E(X)</b> or <b>E[X]</b>, is a generalization of
                            the weighted
                            average, and is intuitively the arithmetic mean of a large number of independent
                            realizations of <b>X</b>.
                            <br> For discrete variable, the formula is
                            <br> E(X) = Î£(P(X) * X)

                        <h3>Variance</h3>
                        <p>Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. In

                            it measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.
                            <br> For discrete variable, the formula is
                            <br> Var(X) = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sup>n</sup> Î£((X-E(X))&#178)

                        <p>a probability distribution is the mathematical function that gives the probabilities of
                            occurrence of different
                            possible outcomes for an experiment. It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon
                            in terms of
                            its sample space and the probabilities of events.
                            <br>There are many types of distribution in statistics.
