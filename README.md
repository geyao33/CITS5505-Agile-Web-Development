# CITS5505-Agile-Web-Development
The developers are Yao Ge (22542651) and Mingbo Zhang (22795074).
## Design
The main design of this project is to allow users to learn simple statistics. Firstly users can login or register to our website. After logging in, the user will be taken to the tutorial page. The tutorial page is divided into two sections. After each section is completed, the user can take a test. The results of the exams are displayed on the spot. Users have the option to favor exams to easily view their progress in their personal panel.
## Development
The back end of the site is a python based flask framework with a lighter SQLite database, and the front end is HTML5, which includes a CSS style bootsrap package and Java Script based Ajax. 
## How to lunch
After confirming the installation of python and the flask package, run myflask.py and a local host will be created. User can experience the page by opening the default routing address http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in his browser.
